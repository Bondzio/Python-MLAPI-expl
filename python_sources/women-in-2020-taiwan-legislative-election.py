# 
# ### Background (Electoral system) 
# 
# The 113 members of the Legislative Yuan are elected by a supplementary member system, with 73 from **geographical constituencies** via first-past-the-post, six from **two nationwide aboriginal constituencies**, each with three members, via single non-transferable vote, and 34 from closed-list **proportional representation (PR)** via a national party vote. Seats are allocated using the Hare quota. In order to qualify for seats based on the party-list vote share, a party must exceed a threshold of 5% of the second votes nationwide. For each party, at least half of the legislators elected under this system must be female.
