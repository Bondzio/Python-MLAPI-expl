# # Machine learning in minutes - very fast fundamental examples in Python

# ## About
# _________
# 
# This notebook contains a series of fast fundamental machine learning examples in Python.
# 	
# The approach is designed to help grasp the applied machine learning lifecycle in minutes. It is not an alternative to actually taking the time to learn. What it aims to do is help someone get started fast and gain intuitive understanding of the typical steps early on.
