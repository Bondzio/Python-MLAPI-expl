# # List of machine learning methods & datasets

# ## About
# _________
# 
# This notebook contains a list fundamental machine learning methods and corresponding practice datasets.
# 	
# The approach is designed to help make the process of finding practice datasets for particular machine learning methods more efficient. Naturally, it is not an alternative to real-world scenarios where we need to find the the appropriate machine learning model to apply to a given problem set. What it aims to do is help someone navigate Kaggle datasets faster and gain intuitive understanding of which types of problems are typically solved with which types of machine learning models.
