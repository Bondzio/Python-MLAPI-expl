# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)# Import TensorFlow
import tensorflow as tf

# Also Import seaborn, a Python graphing library
import warnings # current version of seaborn generates a bunch of warnings that we'll ignore
warnings.filterwarnings("ignore")
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
sns.set(style="white", color_codes=True)
# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory

from subprocess import check_output
print(check_output(["ls", "../input"]).decode("utf8"))

# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.
iris = pd.read_csv('../input/Iris.csv')
print(iris.head())
# Let's see how many examples we have of each species
iris["Species"].value_counts()
# The first way we can plot things is using the .plot extension from Pandas dataframes
# We'll use this to make a scatterplot of the Iris features.
iris.plot(kind="scatter", x="SepalLengthCm", y="SepalWidthCm")
# We can also use the seaborn library to make a similar plot
# A seaborn jointplot shows bivariate scatterplots and univariate histograms in the same figure
sns.jointplot(x="SepalLengthCm", y="SepalWidthCm", data=iris, size=5)
# One piece of information missing in the plots above is what species each plant is
# We'll use seaborn's FacetGrid to color the scatterplot by species
sns.FacetGrid(iris, hue="Species", size=5) \
   .map(plt.scatter, "SepalLengthCm", "SepalWidthCm") \
   .add_legend()
# We can look at an individual feature in Seaborn through a boxplot
sns.boxplot(x="Species", y="PetalLengthCm", data=iris)
# Another useful seaborn plot is the pairplot, which shows the bivariate relation
# between each pair of features
# 
# From the pairplot, we'll see that the Iris-setosa species is separataed from the other
# two across all feature combinations
sns.pairplot(iris.drop("Id", axis=1), hue="Species", size=3)
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
y, X = iris['Species'], iris[['SepalLengthCm', 'SepalWidthCm', 'PetalLengthCm', 'PetalWidthCm']].fillna(0)
