# **Guideline for Take Home Exam 1 of IPE 205:--**
# 1. Roll number 1-30 will work on the dataset "Grading of the students in the exam (IPE101) raw" 
# & the remaining students will work on "Marking of the students in the exam (IPE101) raw". The file name will be "Take home exam 1 2017032\**"
# 2. You will FORK this code & work on that
# 3. In the dataset given, most data is in "String" format, convert them into int/float
# Replace the values of the entire row that match with your roll number with your roll number programmatically. For instance,
# your roll number is 05, replace all values in 5th row with 5
# [[Example of Replacing values](https://github.com/tanmoyie/Applied-Statistics/blob/master/Projects%20%26%20Dataset/Performance%20of%20the%20students%20of%20IPE%2C%20MIST/Replacing%20values.png)]

# 4. 
# variable_x1 = column number equal to the last digit of your roll number. If your roll is 21, you will choose 1st column; 
# variable_y1 = column of total mark in class tests; 
# variable_x2 = any column u wish; 
# variable_y2 = total mark in final exam (the column "Mark total 300")
# Since Python is a 0 indexing language, if your roll number is 201703110 (last digit is 0), 
# you will choose column 1, variable_x1 = dataframe(:,0) 
# 
# 5. Draw a Scatter plot (variable_x1 vs variable_y1) 
# 6. Draw a Scatter plot (variable_x2 vs variable_y2)
# 7. Explan the Scatter plots you obtain
# 8. Draw a Histogram based on your dataset & interpret it
# 9. Draw a Box Plot of your dataset & interpret it.
