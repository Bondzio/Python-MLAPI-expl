# #  Exploratory Data Analysis
# 
# ## [2] Data Cleaning: Deduplication
# 
# It is observed (as shown in the table below) that the reviews data had many duplicate entries. Hence it was necessary to remove duplicates in order to get unbiased results for the analysis of the data.  Following is an example:

# In[ ]:


display= pd.read_sql_query("""
SELECT *
FROM Reviews
WHERE Score != 3 AND UserId="AR5J8UI46CURR"
ORDER BY ProductID
""", con)
display.head()


# As can be seen above the same user has multiple reviews of the with the same values for HelpfulnessNumerator, HelpfulnessDenominator, Score, Time, Summary and Text  and on doing analysis it was found that <br>
# <br> 
# ProductId=B000HDOPZG was Loacker Quadratini Vanilla Wafer Cookies, 8.82-Ounce Packages (Pack of 8)<br>
# <br> 
# ProductId=B000HDL1RQ was Loacker Quadratini Lemon Wafer Cookies, 8.82-Ounce Packages (Pack of 8) and so on<br>
# 
# It was inferred after analysis that reviews with same parameters other than ProductId belonged to the same product just having different flavour or quantity. Hence in order to reduce redundancy it was decided to eliminate the rows having same parameters.<br>
# 
# The method used for the same was that we first sort the data according to ProductId and then just keep the first similar product review and delelte the others. for eg. in the above just the review for ProductId=B000HDL1RQ remains. This method ensures that there is only one representative for each product and deduplication without sorting would lead to possibility of different representatives still existing for the same product.

# In[ ]:


#Sorting data according to ProductId in ascending order
sorted_data=filtered_data.sort_values('ProductId', axis=0, ascending=True, inplace=False, kind='quicksort', na_position='last')

#Checking to see how much % of data still remains
(final['Id'].size*1.0)/(filtered_data['Id'].size*1.0)*100


# <b>Observation:-</b> It was also seen that in two rows given below the value of HelpfulnessNumerator is greater than HelpfulnessDenominator which is not practically possible hence these two rows too are removed from calcualtions

#Before starting the next phase of preprocessing lets see the number of entries left

final['Score'].value_counts()


# # [3].  Text Preprocessing.
# 
# Now that we have finished deduplication our data requires some preprocessing before we go on further with analysis and making the prediction model.
# 
# Hence in the Preprocessing phase we do the following in the order below:-
# 
# 1. Begin by removing the html tags
# 2. Remove any punctuations or limited set of special characters like , or . or # etc.
# 3. Check if the word is made up of english letters and is not alpha-numeric
# 4. Check to see if the length of the word is greater than 2 (as it was researched that there is no adjective in 2-letters)
# 5. Convert the word to lowercase
# 6. Remove Stopwords
# 7. Finally Snowball Stemming the word (it was obsereved to be better than Porter Stemming)<br>
# 
# After which we collect the words used to describe positive and negative reviews
