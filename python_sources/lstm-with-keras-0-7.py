# # LSTM with score <0.7
# 
# * I've just run the reference kernel and I've got this score. https://www.kaggle.com/bountyhunters/baseline-lstm-with-keras-0-8
# 
# Question: why the score is changing so much? Does it related to seeds? As far as I read from some researches withoud seed LSTM is giving better results but I'm not sure what is the reason for changing of score like this?
