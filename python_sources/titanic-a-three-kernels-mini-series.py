# I wrote three short, entry-level, kernels on Titanic. They form a series, or a pipeline, where the second and third kernels leverage the output from the previous one. I wrote the kernels this way for my own easy reading, as I find long kernels hard to read and difficult to maintain. If you get to read the series I hope you will find it useful; it was certainly very educational for me to write it.
# 
# Kernels in the series are:

# * [Titanic Data Exploration](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/urls/gitlab.com/pirivan/dataware/raw/master/pydata/titanic/titanic-2.ipynb)
