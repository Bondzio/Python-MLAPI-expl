# # Intro
# **This is your workspace for Kaggle's Machine Learning course**
# 
# You will build and continually improve a model to predict housing prices as you work through each tutorial.
# 
# The tutorials you read use data from Melbourne. The Melbourne data is not available in this workspace.  Instead, you will translate the concepts to work with the data in this notebook, the Iowa data.
# 
# # Write Your Code Below
# 

# In[64]:


import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor

# Read data 
main_file_path = '../input/train.csv' # this is the path to the Iowa data that you will use
train = pd.read_csv(main_file_path)

# pull data into target (y) and predictors (X)
train_y = train.SalePrice
predictor_cols = ['LotArea', 'OverallQual', 'YearBuilt', 'TotRmsAbvGrd']

# Create training predictors data
train_X = train[predictor_cols]

my_model = RandomForestRegressor()
my_model.fit(train_X, train_y)


# In[65]:


# Read the test data
test = pd.read_csv('../input/test.csv')
# Treat the test data in the same way as training data. In this case, pull same columns.
test_X = test[predictor_cols]
# Use the model to make predictions
predicted_prices = my_model.predict(test_X)
# We will look at the predicted prices to ensure we have something sensible.
print(predicted_prices)


# In[ ]:


my_submission = pd.DataFrame({'Id': test.Id, 'SalePrice': predicted_prices})
# you could use any filename. We choose submission here
my_submission.to_csv('submission.csv', index=False)
