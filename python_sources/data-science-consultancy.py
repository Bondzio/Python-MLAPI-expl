# Usually, consulting part revolves around 4 main questions;
# 
# * What is the insight?
# * What needs to be done?
# * How it should be done?
# * What should be the process?

# # Terms
# 
# ### Features
# A feature is something that describes a class, features are split into Categorical Features and Continuous Features. 
# 
# ### Categorical Features
# Features that can be split into distinct categories, usually are more descriptive. 
# 
# Example: Tall, Short, Big, Small, Blue, Red, Green, Expensive, Cheap, Premium, Free, etc...
# 
# ### Continuous Features
# Usually are numerical features that cannot be split into distinct categories without loosing information. 
# 
# Example: Height, Age, Mass, Cost etc... 
# 
# Continuous Features can be transformed into categorical data if need be. 
# 
# ### Classification
# Given a set of features, and observations a model is able to predict what class an observation belongs to. 
# 
# Example: 
# * Determining whether an a given person is fit or not, given mass, height, red blood cells, phagocytes, lymphocytes etc..
# * Determining whether a company will be profitable or not given financial information about it. 
# 
# ### Regression
# Regression can be performed using Categorical Data or Continuous Data or even a mix of both. The difference between regression and classification, is that, regression outputs a continuous number rather than a single class. 
# 
# For Example: Predicting the price of a house given: Country, Location of Property, Area in (m^2), whether it is newly built or not (or even the date of construction instead), whether a school is available nearby.

# ## Health 
# ## Image Classification
# Image classification can be used for classifying whether a patient is suffering from a certain disease or not. A great example of this,that is actively being used in the medical industry, is breast cancer detection and classification. Given an stained image of a tissue, the model is not only able to predict whether the patient is suffering from cancer or not, but also where the cancer is occuring in the image.   
# ## Disease Prediction
# We can also predict what type of diseases that a patient is likely to encounter, and when he is likely to suffer from them as well, given his parents' medical record. 
# 
# ## Seasonality Analysis
# We can predict how fast a virus can spread, depending on the type of virus, the location, the number of people currently suffering from it, etc...

# ## Engineering
# * ### Financial Data Analysis
# * ### Decision Making Recommendations
# * ### Data Cleaning & Data Prepping 
# * ### Visualization Services
# * ### Best Data Practices Recommendation
# * ### Computer Vision
# * ### Applicant CV Shortlisting, Clustering

# ## Electricity 
# * ### Grid Power Management
# * ### Building Electrical Data Analysis and Modelling
# * ### Automatic Output Adjustment
# We can predict the most efficient times to turn on heating or cooling services within the building given the traffic data of the building, outside temperature data, month, day, etc..

# ## Online Retailers & News Agencies
# * ### Clustering items/news
# * ### Tracking Customer/Reader Habits
# * ### Build Recommender Systems
# * ### Targeted Ads/News

# ## Manufacturing
# * ### Predictive Maintenance using Sensor Data
# * ### Computer Vision to detect faulty parts
# * ### Sales Forecasting 
# With Sales forecasting a firm can predict whether they need ramp up manufacturing to keep up with the demand.
# * ### Predicting quality of manufactured items based on factory conditions
