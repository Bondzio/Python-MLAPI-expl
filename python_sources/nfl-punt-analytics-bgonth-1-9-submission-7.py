# # Changes to incorporate when trying to reduce concussions on punt plays:
# 
# 1. Need to enforce stricter leading with helmet calls, so that players are not incentivized to lead with their helmet when tackling or blocking.
# 2. Need to make slight modification to the standard punt formation rules that will reduce the velocity of the players to minimize chance of concussion occurring.
# 
# 
# The notebook below goes over the above proposals along with the corresponding analysis that supports these proposals.

# # Findings
# 
# It was found that there are two main factors of concussion inducing plays on punt returns.
# 
# * The dangerous form of blocking or tackling leading with the helmet
# * The faster velocity that occurs on punt-plays as opposed to the standard run or pass plays that are in a football game.
# 
# The combination of both of these factors increase the probability of players experiencing a concussion.
# 
# To change the playerâ€™s behavior of leading with the helmet when they block or tackle, the NFL needs to enforce stricter penalties similar to the new targeting rules that college football has put in place.
# 
# 
# To reduce the average player velocity during a punt play, the traditional punt play formations for the returning and coverage team needs to be altered.
# 
# * Only 4 players are allowed on or near the line of scrimmage by the ball snap location for each team, otherwise it would be called an illegal formation.
# 
# Explanation for both of these rule changes are in the data analysis are in this notebook.

# # NGS Data Analysis of Video Review
# 
# * Note: The concussion_inv dataset was created in the later part of the notebook, but for presentation purposes it needed to be uploaded as a private dataset to Kaggle Server

# 
# * Concussion occurred when non-injured player (#36 for Bills) ran into injured (#13 for 49ers) player at full speed while the injured player lead with his helmet.
# 
# **Notes:**
# 
# * During impact that occurred, the difference in velocity between the injured and non-injured players was approximately 5 yds/sec. 
# 
# 
# * The punt returned that did occur was on a punt return that lasted approximately 14 seconds because the returner was able to gain decent yardage on the return, which lengthened the play.
# 
# 
# * The fact that the injured player lead with his head when there was a large difference in velocity at impact, helped prompt the concussion.  If the player did not lead with his helmet, then the chances that a concussion would have occurred would have lessened.

# * Concussion occurred when non-injured player (#2 for Broncos) was running at near  full speed and the injured player (#25 for Bears) was running at full speed.
# 
# 
# * Worth noting that the injured player lead with his helmet, which caused the concussion.
# 
# **Notes**
# 
# * In this scenario, there was a high speed collision between both of the players.  High speed collisions generate more energy and can increase the probability of concussions.
# 
# 
# * The punt lasted around 12 seconds and the returner was able to return the punt for a decent yardage gain, which allowed the players to build up momentum.
# 
# 
# * The injured player was able to gain speed to the point where his head first tackle caused a concussion, otherwise a concussion could have been prevented.

# * Concussion occurred when the injured player (#86 for Panthers) was running at near full speed and was blindsided by an oncoming blocker (#28 for Titans) who led with his helmet.
# 
# **Notes**
# 
# * As opposed to the other scenarios, this punt was punted across the 50 yard line, was short and was downed inside the 20 yard line.
# 
# 
# * However, even though this punt play was only around  6 seconds, the players were able to accelerate quickly and were at near full speed when the concussion occurred 4 seconds into the play. 
# 
# 
# * The non-injured player lead in helmet first into the oncoming tackler, which caused the concussion.

# # Proposed Rule Changes
# 
# **A common theme of concussions that occur are twofold:**
# 
# 1. Improper Tackling or Blocking Leading with Helmet
#     * Some of which are intentional and are unintentional (due to biomechanics)
#     * Can cause sudden change in movement of the head, which lead to concussions
# 
# 
# 
# 2. High Velocity Impact
#     * Leads to larger energy transfer, which can increase probability of concussion
# 
# ## Dangerous Tackling/Blocking Form
# 
# * The data shows concussions induced from helmet to helmet contact, which are more intentional, are still prevalent on punt plays and make up for 45.9% of all concussions on punts in 2016-2017

# * The resulting p-value is 0.51.  This means there is a 51% chance that this rule change caused a significant reduction in concussions, which means there is no significant statistical evidence to support that claim.
# 
# 
# * From the Chi-Square analysis, stricter rule changes need to be made to prevent this dangerous tackling and blocking form.
#     * This assumes that the rules added to the 2018 NFL Rule book have not reduced the number of concussions on punt plays.
#     
#       
#     
# * A radical new rule for the NFL can incorporate a similar targeting rule employed in college football to help eliminate this dangerous football move to massively reduce number of concussions.
#     1. First review can be done to establish intent of the helmet leading tackle or block of which will either confirm or reverse the call.
#     2. If a player is charged with two targeting calls, then the player is removed from the game.

# # Similar NBA Ejection Structure to Proposed Solution

# * A similar ejection rule structure is emphasized in the NBA, where if one player gets two technical fouls, then they are ejected from the game.

# * The data shows that for hits that occur at faster speeds, concussions are more likely.  However, for concussions that occur at slower speeds, helmet to helmet contact is the only causing factor.
# 
# 
# * With this said, even though the velocity statistics are not statistically different between punt plays with concussions versus those without, the punt play formation still needs to be changed to fundamentally help reduce the average player speed as much as possible to reduce concussion provoking plays.
# 
# 
# * To maintain the integrity of the game so that the resulting punt play is similar to the original, only the formation alignment will be changed to reduce the average playerâ€™s velocity on punt plays to help reduce concussions.
# 

# # Proposed Rule Changes: 
#   **Changing the Punt Formation**  

# * An area of interest is to identify the players who are most frequently involved in concussion inducing punt plays.
# 
# 
# * Concussion Player Involvement is identified as being a player who either experiences a concussion or whose contact triggers a concussion of another player.
# 
# 
# * Is important to understand which positions of a punt formation are more likely to have concussion player involvement and identify why those positions are more likely to induce concussions.

# * Statistically proving that both of these samples of velocities between the punt gunners and the punt non-gunners, a 2 sample independent t-test was used
# 
# 
# * The test gave a p-value of 2.47e-81.  That means that both of these samples statistically have a different velocity population.
# 
# 
# * Therefore, the gunner position is statistically slower at the time when a punt is fair caught or fielded than the non-gunner positions that are at or near the line of scrimmage by the ball snap location.
# 

# # Proposed Rule Changes
# ## Changing the Punt Formation: 
# ### Proposed Solution

# * It would comprise of reducing the allowed number of players at or near the line of scrimmage by the ball snap location for both the return team and the coverage team.
# 
# 
# * Currently there are at least 10 players at or near the line of scrimmage by the ball snap location.
# 
# 
# * By allowing only 8 players in this area, this will reduce the number of players who are running full speed down the field.

# ### Proposed Solution Consequences:
# 
# 
# * Would increase the number of fair catches 
# 
# 
# * Should limit the number of punts fielded
# 
# 
# 
# * Would limit the number of concussions experienced by the punt returner
# 
# 
# * More teams will line up players who are not typical blockers or rushers in the gunner position, which would reduce the collision force.
# 
# 
# * Still gives the punt returner a chance to field the punt so the punt play is still preserved
# 
# 
# * Less Dense Field in specific parts of the field to avoid accidental collisions between players
# 
# 
# * Still allows coaches to come up with other punt return/coverage formations that follow the new line of scrimmage rule.

# # Conclusion

# * The NFL needs to focus on enforcing stricter penalties for leading with the helmet on contact plays:
#     * First review can be done to establish intent of the helmet leading tackle or block of which will either confirm or reverse the call.
#     * If a player is charged with two targeting calls, then the player is removed from the game.
# 
# 
# * The NFL needs to enforce a particular type of punt return or punt coverage formation to reduce the velocities of players on punts:
#     * Limit the number of players allowed near the ball snap location to 4 players per team
