# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)
from sklearn.metrics import log_loss

# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory

from subprocess import check_output
print(check_output(["ls", "../input"]).decode("utf8"))

df_train = pd.read_csv('../input/stage1_labels.csv')
sample = pd.read_csv('../input/stage1_sample_submission.csv')
sample['cancer'] = df_train.cancer.mean()
sample.to_csv('submission1.csv')

# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.
