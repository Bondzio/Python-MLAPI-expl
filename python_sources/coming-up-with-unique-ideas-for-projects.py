# There are two general approaches I take: 
# 
# * Take an existing method (regression technique, visualziation, deep learning architechture) and apply it to a new dataset
# * Use a technique in a new way (also with a new dataset) Example: https://www.kaggle.com/nateaff/finding-lego-color-themes-with-topic-models 
# 
# Some tips:
# 
# * Stear clear of very common datasets (e.g. anything from the [UCI data repository](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/datasets))
# * It's fine to reuse someone else's code, but make sure you know what it does
# * Highlight your strengths (domain knowledge, clear techincal writing, data visualation)
# * Find a project you're excited about

# My process: 
# 
# 1. Start with a dataset (I like to go to the datasets listing & sort by recently updated. Then pick one without a lot of anlyses on it.)
#     * Google's dataset search: https://toolbox.google.com/datasetsearch 
# 2. Look over the dataset
#     * Think about what questions you could answer with this
#     * If it were data from someone's business, what would they want to know about it? 
#     * What needs to be done to the data before you can analyze it (data cleaning)? Can you show off your abilty to handle tricky problems?
# 3. If you like, look at analyses on similar types of datasets
# 4. Exploratory data anlaysis
# 
# Either: 
# 
# 5. Find the most interesting thing in the anlysis & expand on it (including other related datasets)
# 6. Build your story around the interesting finding, making sure to answer the question "so what? why is this important?" 
# 
# OR: 
# 
# 5. Find a technique that is usually applied to this sort of problem & apply it
# 6. Include some text introdcuing the technique and why you chose it
