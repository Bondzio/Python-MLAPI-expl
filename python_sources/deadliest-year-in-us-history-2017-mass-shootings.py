# **Deadliest Year in U.S. History in Terms of Mass Shootings**
# 
# In this viz I try to bring to light the data from the deadliest year in US shootings. It is considered a mass shooting when 5+ people are shot. Here I utilize Tableau's story function to highlight the differences in data. The first is the difference visually from before Las Vegas, and then after. Also, there is a comparison of the event at the beginning of the year in Florida with a similar event that most likely don't remember as well. There is also a comparison to the number of people whom are actually killed versus those who are wounded.
# 
# My wish is that becoming aware of these incidents makes it possible for us as humans to internalize the events that have occurred, and therefore are then able to finally move on past them. I now believe that as data scientists, we should attempt to analyze any set of data impartially, and use our reasoning faculties to retrieve any sort of insight that may have occurred.
