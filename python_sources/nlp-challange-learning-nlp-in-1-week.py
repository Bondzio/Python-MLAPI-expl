# # NLP Challange.
# 
# I have decided a idealistic challange for myself that is learning NLP in 1 week 
# then participating in  "Jigsaw Multilingual Toxic comment classification challange"
# 
# I am going to write all the things I will learn in different notebooks.
# 
# 
# This the notebook where i apply some things I learned in my 1 week challange
# [Jigsaw - tensorflow hub vs Hugging face](https://www.kaggle.com/maunish/jigsaw-tensorflow-hub-vs-hugging-face)
# 
# 
# 
# Below are the  notebooks which covers my whole 1 week journey.
#
