# **What is a data science portfolio?**
# 
# A collection of completed projects that are examples of your data science work.
# ____
# 
# Two goals: 
# 
# * Highlight your knowledge: Show you know you stuff. 
# * Show that you'd be good to work with: Teamwork is essential. 

# **Highlighting knowledge**
# 
# What type of job do you want? 
# 
# If you want to be building systems/engineering/building pipelines (more on the **machine learning engineering side**) then focus on building end-to-end projects. Show that you can:
# 
# * Come up with good/new ideas (not the place for Titanic!)
# * Finish projects that work (build a working prototype)
# * Clearly articulate the value of what you've built to a non-data-scientist (<- super important!)
# 
# If you're looking for more of an analysis/data storytelling/measurement/A/B testing job (more like **analytics**) then you need to show:
# 
# * That you can find new information in data
# * That you can succinctly communicate that information to a variety of stakeholders (i.e. people who care)
# 
# > Communication is very, very important no matter what role you play. Put your portfolio together keeping in mind that both technical & non-technical people will read it.

# 
# Qualities of a good portfolio: 
# 
# * Diverse (you don't need to show every project on every application, but having a lot of kinds of projects will help you apply to more jobs).  I would recommend:
#   * A text-based project
#   * An image project
#   * Time series analysis
#   * Some sort of A/B testing/hypothesis testing
#   * A visualization project
#   * A geo/mapping project
#   * A really intense data cleaning project (multiple datasets, missing data that requires imputation)
#   * Regression analysis
#   * Something that uses SQL
# * Show that you can work in a reproducible way & follow (some) software engineering best practices
#   * Version/source control (git, I reccomend this guide: http://happygitwithr.com/)
#   * Not putting everything in one big Jupyter/R Markdown file. Put functions in a seperate file and import them, split data cleaning and data analysis/modelling.
#   * Use a linter/follow a style guide (e.g. PEP8 for Python, Tidyverse style guide for R)
# * Work that is to the point. I personally would avoid large exploratory data analysis projects in your portfolio.
# * Clear explanatory text. What did you, why did you do it and why is it important? If you use a particularly unusual technique, can you explain it and show that it preforms better than some baseline (e.g. regression).
