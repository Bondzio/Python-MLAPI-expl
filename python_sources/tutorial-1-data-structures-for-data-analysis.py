# 
# ---

# These are a few steps for getting started with Pyton for data analysis. It serves as a preparation for Tutorials 2-6.

# 1. If you have no Python experience complete Lessons 1-5 in the free Udacity online course Introduction to Python Programming at https://eu.udacity.com/course/introduction-to-python--ud1110.
# 2. Open a new Jupyter Notebook.
# 3. In your notebook, replicate the example code for data structures list, string, tuple and dictionary in section 2 (Python Libraries and Data Structures) at https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2016/01/complete-tutorial-learn-data-science-python-scratch-2/. Feel free (and encouraged) to experiment with changing the code and adding more code.
