# Investigation of [airplane crashes dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/saurograndi/airplane-crashes-since-1908).
# 
# Kaggle notebook that I created, was transformed into an absolute mess. I tried to recover it but with no success.

# Now I give up and [uploaded my notebook to github](https://github.com/salvador-dali/kaggle/blob/master/public_notebooks/01_airplane_crashes/investigation.md).
# 
# Here I will just show the most interesting plot with location of half of the crashes. My notebook has way more stuff there.
