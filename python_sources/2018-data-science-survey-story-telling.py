#I have seen many people has already done the dashboards in order to anyalze the data, i have decided to write only story based on the results
#Based on the results, on time taken to complete the survey is increased compared to 2017, i got the insights is average person is taking very less time.
#after refering the dashboard i conclude that, the machine learning and data analytics is going to impact in coming years because the users has started 1 year back to learn things 
#And one thing is clear that python and R languages are used by many users in order to anaylze the things
#Interst in data science and machine learning are boomimg from university, who is pursing master's degree and they doing thesis in machine learning domain
#By analyzing the dashboard the data scientists are very less in companies but i was pretty sure coming trend is only in machine learning and data analytics
#Learners are very much intersted in learning new things by online courses in order reduce their work load
#The New learners is who got good results are very intersted to share their results via online medium
