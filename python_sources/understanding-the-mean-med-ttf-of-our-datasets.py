0.13 * 2624


# # This means there are about 341 segments in the public LB. What does the mean of the private LB have to be such that the mean of the entire test equals 5.678285, i.e. the mean of the entire test equals the mean of the entire train?

# In[ ]:


np.append(np.repeat(4.017, 341), np.repeat(5.926423, 2624-341)).mean()


# # So, if the test resembles the train, we expect the private LB to have a mean of 5.926423; thus, I am okay with higher-biased models.

# # So, if we want a hedge away from the predictions made by the pixel measurements from the p4677 data, we could have a submission that scales to average LB prediction of 5.926423. This can be either from scaling, or from a new CV scheme.
