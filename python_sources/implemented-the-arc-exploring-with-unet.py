# ## What is this notebook?
# I have implemented this great notebook (https://www.kaggle.com/joatom/arc-exploring-with-unet) into the unseen test dataset. It could not solve the unseen test dataset, but it was worth to try.

# ## How can you see the results?
# You can see the results by checking the version history of this notebook.
# 
# * Version 3: For the unseen test data 0-19
# 
# (https://www.kaggle.com/hdsk38/implemented-the-arc-exploring-with-unet?scriptVersionId=31535220)
# 
# * Version 4: For the unseen test data 20-39
# 
# (https://www.kaggle.com/hdsk38/implemented-the-arc-exploring-with-unet?scriptVersionId=31539840)
# 
# * Version 5: For the unseen test data 40-59
#

# 
# * Version 6: For the unseen test data 60-79
# 
# (https://www.kaggle.com/hdsk38/implemented-the-arc-exploring-with-unet?scriptVersionId=31546716)
# 
# * Version 7: For the unseen test data 80-99

# ## Note
# Initially, I did not plan to share the notebook, therefore the Version 3 to Version 7 look quite messy, but I hope you can still find it helpful. Thank you.
