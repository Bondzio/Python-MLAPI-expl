# ## This is a fork of Gilles Vandewiele aka @group16's kernel https://www.kaggle.com/group16/private-0-9688-a-better-but-useless-solution (please upvote his kernel) but using ragnar's [clean_kalman](https://www.kaggle.com/ragnar123/clean-kalman) data. 
# 
# ### This kernel scored 0.97266 on the private LB i.e. 0.00386 better than the score with Chris Deotte's clean data. Gilles had the best title for the kernel and should have been the title of the competition as a whole IMHO. With a ridiculously low local CV and public LB score but private LB of 0.97266, the community outrage about this data is well deserved.

# # The hunt for a good private score
# 
# It seems that the only things that matter to the organizers is a good private score. As such, finding mistakes made by the organizers are rewarded more than building a solution that generalizes to other data. We therefore provide a solution in this notebook that should be deemed as a lot "better" than our current solution to the organizers. It is competely useless, will not work on any types of other data, but hey, it scores better on the private LB! And isn't that all that matters?
