# **https://www.kaggle.com/docs/kernels#modifying-the-default-environment
# 
# **I will also show you how to do this in 4 steps**

# **1. First, remember that custom pacages are not supported for *GPU instances, so you have to turn off your  GPU***
# 
# **2. Remeber to have you *"Internet" option ON*.**
# 
# **3. If those requirements are met, then you will see "Install" option in your setting area.**
# 
# **4. To install your favourite packages just use *"!pip install "package_name"****
# 
# I hope it will help you :)
