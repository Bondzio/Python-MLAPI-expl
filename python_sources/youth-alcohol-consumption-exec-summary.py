# # Investigation into factors predicting student alcohol consumption
# # Business Understanding
# The aim of this data mining project is to:
# * investigate the Student Alcohol Consumption dataset for suitability to investigate the questions below.
# * to build and evaluate prediction models that:
#     * predict student alcohol consumption (specifically, problematic consumption).
#     * predict student academic achievement (secondary goal)
#     * predict overall student health (secondary goal)
# * to aid in this prediction, the dataset provides data on the student themselves, as well as their school, academic record, home situation, extracurricular activities and alcohol consumption.
# 
# # Executive Summary
# * During the data preparation and data understanding phases, it became apparent that the dataset might be too small to build an effective model.
# * Modelling continued to establish learning curves to see if emergent relationships could increase stakeholder buy-in and open possibility to recruit more participants.
# * [Models of heavy consumption](https://www.kaggle.com/joeycorea/heavyalcoholconsumptionmodelling) suggest a relationship between student conscientousness and heavy consumption.
