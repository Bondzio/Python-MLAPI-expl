# Hi, I have created a python notebook exploring the full-size dataset. There were some insights which I could not get from the sample set. I couldn't run it in Kaggle kernals and it wouldn't let me upload without running. So I have uploaded the notebook to github. I hope the community finds it helpful. Here is the link :
