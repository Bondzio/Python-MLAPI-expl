# In this Notebook we explain how we get this dataset.

# The Magellan mission to Venus (https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/imgcat/html/object_page/mgn_f20s003_1.html) to scan the ground via radar images was the inspired dataset that we choose to create this. It was composed of radar images with the coordinate of possible volcanoes.

# We takes this images and the coordinates and mark them.

# After that we crop and create the dataset that we present here in Kaggle.

# 
# This dataset is very old and the images are of low quality, since it was donated at  July 9, 1999, according to  Original Owner, Michael C. Burl. 
# 
# Currently the quality of the images it has improved a lot...
