# Kaggle is like the most usefull resource on practical AI that we can possibly find today! Have you ever wanted to play around with the AMAZING Kaggle datasets ( Who doesn't right?) ? If you don't know to create your first Kernel in any competition, buckle in!
# 

# ### Getting Started!
# If you are new to Kaggle, you can create your account with
# 
# * Google
# * Facebook
# * Kaggle itself
# 
# ![Creating your account](https://jhonatandasilva.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/0blog.png)
# 
# ### You already logged in Kaggle
# 
# Ok, Now you already have logged into Kaggle, to start playind around you can go to the competitions. You can have a look at the most recent and what prizes they offer.

# 
# ### Looking at the competitions
# 
# In this tutorial we're going to be creating for the recent ( late 2018 ) Humpback Whale Identification Challenge, but you can explore so many others like the PetFinder. MNIST is a good place to start, you can look have a look at how simple it is.

# 
# ### Creating your first Kernel
# 
# Now we get to the competitions page, you can see a blue button called "New Kernel", just press it .

# 
# ### Using Jupyter NOTEBOOKS
# 
# If you have never heard of [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) ( Do you live in a cave? hahhaa ). They are an amazing resource to share replicable code, they were used even for the [Gravitational Waves](https://www.gw-openscience.org/GW150914data/GW150914_tutorial.html)! Pretty amazing not? We are going to be using them in our Kernels at Kaggle

# 
# ### Game ON!
# 
# Now the Game is On! We can have amazing Kernels and share with the community!

# 
# ### Commiting your changes
# 
# If you aren't familiar with the term commit have a look [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruieT3Nkg2M) (This channel has also Amazing resources within the Data Science field! ). You can commit your changes, don't worry, this wont make your Kernel public yet, you can go nuts!

# 
# ### Your profile has your Kernels! 
# 
# You finished all your code and tests and now you are ready to move on! Make the final commit and go to your profile. There lies your precious Kernels!

# 
# ### Almost There!
# 
# You can open your Kernel by clicling on the title
#

# 
# ### Go PUBLIC
# 
# To make your now Private Kernel Public you need to click on the "Access" button
# 
# ![](https://jhonatandasilva.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/10blog.png)
# 
# ### Be PROUD
# 
# Change the Privacy Options from Private to Public and that's it! But wait, my kernel isn't showing up, I know I know, I've been were you are. If you went to the [public kernels](https://www.kaggle.com/c/humpback-whale-identification/kernels) and didn't find your own, don't panic, the Kaggle website takes sometime to update the Kernels. Now be PROUD, you've made your very first public Kernel!
