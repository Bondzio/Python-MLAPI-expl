# A generic framework attempted having the following features <br>
# a) generate vocabulary - with title/body_text/ headers etc as function parametes in the research paper object<br>
# b) generate word counts<br>
# c) inverted_index with scoring(has issues though in merging inverted indexes, WIP)<br>
# d) scoring based on log term frequency and log inverse document frequency (functionality to be verified, WIP)
# d) definitions for the column names<br>
# e) table formats for summary tables<br>
# 
# using producer consumer (having buffers/queues) model that enables developers to focus on the tasks/research challanges than the initial preprocessing steps
