# NeuralSection or ("a Neural Section") is a brain that grows on its own, by simply feeding it x amount of inputs, with x amount of expected outputs.
# Training can take a little bit longer than static neural networks as it is building its own network to achieve a higher "fitness".
# 
# This notebook is dedicated to the usage of a "Neural Section" that learns to recognize digits simply by feeding it the training data,
# without configurations to the section itself, as there is no way to configure a Neural Section.
# 
# I will release more information about NeuralSection very soon.
# 
# Let's see how far we can get!
