# ## Covid-19 In the World

# In this kernel i showed last coronavirus situation on a Tableau dashboard. There was a kernel I had done created about the Coronavirus about 1.5 months ago. Much has changed since. There were only a few cases in Europe and no deaths yet. Today, the virus has spread to all continents except Antarctica. You can check out my previous kernel [here](https://www.kaggle.com/fatihbilgin/the-beginning-of-coronavirus-outbreak).

# ## Covid-19 In the United States And China

# For comparison, i have shown America and China below with their provinces and states. Wuhan was in a central position for official cases in China. As seen on the map, New York is in a similar position today. But unlike China, there are other states in US that stand out.

# The first known case of COVID-19 in the U.S. was confirmed on January 20, 2020, in a 35-year-old who had returned from Wuhan, China, five days earlier. On January 29, the White House Coronavirus Task Force was established. Two days later, the Trump administration declared a public health emergency and announced a ban of most foreign nationals arriving from China. On February 26, a person with "no known exposure to the virus through travel or close contact with a known infected individual" was confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
