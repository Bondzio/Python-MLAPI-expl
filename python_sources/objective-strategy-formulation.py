# # Objective/Strategy formulation
# 
# Something different will be done in this kernel. Instead of it being a data-focused kernel, it will be focused on PASSNYC, their objectives and the problem they are trying to solve.
# 
# I feel like this is much needed before we tackle a problem, so, here is a view on the whole thing.

# # Vision
# 
# In the end, everyone wants to improve society. And in which ways does PASSNYC do it? It focus on the life of students.
# 
# But, for each student, what is important is different. So, we focus on a specific group, whose needs are similar.
# 
# What is this group?
# 
# > Students from the *hard walks of life* that could benefit from taking the SHSAT or receiving assistance toward it.
# 
# And who composes this group?
# 
# - Students who would take the SHSAT if they knew about it (but they don't)
# - Students who would take the SHSAT if they knew a bit more about it (or received some kind of assistance)
# - Students who will take the SHSAT and could benefit from receiving assistance towards it

# # How do we help each subgroup?
# 
# ## Students who would take the SHSAT if they knew about it
# 
# These students could benefit basically from getting to know SHSAT.
# 
# - How do we find them?
# - How do we let them find us?
# - How can we best inform them?
# 
# And some indirect questions:
# 
# - Who knows about SHSAT?
# - How do people get to know about it?
# 
# ## Students who would take the SHSAT if they knew a bit more about it
# 
# These students already know about the SHSAT, but aren't willing to take the test. This may be due to confidence issues, lack of guidance, or something that the student doesn't know or know wrongly.
# 
# *care must be taken in this group not to promote SHSAT blindly*
# 
# - How do we find them?
# - How do we let them find us?
# - What makes them not willing to take the SHSAT?
# 
# More openly:
# 
# - Why does someone want to go/not go to SPHS (specialized high schools)?
# - Why does someone wants to take/not take the SHSAT?
# 
# ## Students who will take the SHSAT and could benefit from receiving assistance towards it
# 
# These students already know about SHSAT and are already willing to take it. They just need some help. This help can be given in form of assistance and direction.
# 
# - How do we find them?
# - How do we let them find us?
# - What are the needs of each student?
# - What is the best way to guide them?

# # General questions
# 
# Based on the previous subgroups, these questions were formulated taking everyone into account:
# 
# ## How/Where do we find the targets?
# 
# This looks like the main question that was provided by PASSNYC. Since our data is school-based, we must direct the efforts towards schools, not specific students. Some ideas include:
# 
# - Find groups of schools where PASSNYC can have a great influence
# - Rank schools based on the influence that we can have on them
# - Use a low-cost strategy for finding specific targets amidst the big environment (e.g. calling schools to ask about stellar students)
# 
# ## How/Where does the target find us?
# 
# This seems like a promising strategy. Insteading of reaching out to students, let them reach out for us. Examples of this include:
# 
# - Posting papers at schools
# - Presence in the internet
# - Presence in places where students would search for help. This includes physical places, knowledge among teachers or even easiness to be found on the internet (PASSNYC site ranks #5 when you search for 'how to prepare for shsat?' on Google)
# 
# We want to reduce the effort that a student must take to reach us.
# 
# ## Why is it that students want to go to SPHS or not?
# 
# This question is really important, because, based on it, we can know which groups would benefit most from PASSNYC and how to approach the students in a good manner. For example, some kinds of student may not want to go to SPHS because they have no conditions of doing so. If there is a certain kind of assistance that helps them in this area, we can point them torwards it, and the problem is solved.
# 
# ## Why is it that students want to take SHSAT or not?
# 
# This question is somewhat close to the last one.
# 
# One thing I want to note is that, right now, there hasn't been much focus on the "why" of things. Instead, we know "who" takes the SHSAT and "who" doesn't. Specific focus on the "why" of things would be helpful. However, as we would need to make some kind of research to understand it, it could cost a lot of money.
# 
# ## What our targets could mostly benefit from?
# 
# This question reveals what seems to be the essence of PASSNYC: building a repository of useful resources and guiding students through this alien ground.
# 
# Some things that would be helpful in this area:
# 
# - Understand student needs as a whole, but also,
# - Have people that communicate with students to understand *specific* needs
# - Have a good list of resources that is easily scanned through
# - Have a complex list of resources and guidance on how to use it or which way to follow

# # The role of PASSNYC
# 
# Based on the preview assertions, it looks PASSNYC has two main roles:
# 
# - Promote and spread knowledge about the SHSAT
# - Be a repository of resources and a guide for them
# 
# And one potential role:
# 
# - Generate knowledge about SPHS's and SHSAT that could be useful in other areas

# # So, what can we do to help PASSNYC?
# 
# Among its role, the resources that PASSNYC have are limited. So, what we could do (and what they ask of us) is to create a way of choosing where resources are allocated. Also, anything that helps PASSNYC answer some of the questions above of fulfill the roles is also useful.
# 
# Here are some ideas:
# 
# - Give information for PASSNYC to help them choose which areas or schools to act on first
# - Help them collect crucial information about students (e.g. one could point out schools that would serve as good targets in a survey)
# - Find more resources for students (for example, [this kernel][1] located libraries which were in the vinicity of schools)

# I hope this kernel may be helpful to some. If you have any questions or suggestions, or just want to add something, leave a comment!
