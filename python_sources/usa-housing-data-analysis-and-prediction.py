# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)

# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory

import os
print(os.listdir("../input"))

# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.


# **Let's get started!**
# ## Check out the data
# We've been able to get some data from the client for housing prices as a csv set, let's get our environment ready with the libraries we'll need and then import the data!
# ### Import Libraries

# In[ ]:


import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
get_ipython().run_line_magic('matplotlib', 'inline')


# In[ ]:


USAhousing = pd.read_csv('../input/USA_Housing.csv')


# In[ ]:


USAhousing.head()


# In[ ]:


USAhousing.info()


# In[ ]:


USAhousing.describe()


# In[ ]:


sns.pairplot(USAhousing)


# In[ ]:


sns.distplot(USAhousing['Price'])


# In[ ]:


sns.heatmap(USAhousing.corr())


# ## Training a Linear Regression Model
# 
# Let's now begin to train out regression model! We will need to first split up our data into an X array that contains the features to train on, and a y array with the target variable, in this case the Price column. We will toss out the Address column because it only has text info that the linear regression model can't use.
# 
# ### X and y arrays

# In[ ]:


X = USAhousing[['Avg. Area Income', 'Avg. Area House Age', 'Avg. Area Number of Rooms',
               'Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms', 'Area Population']]
y = USAhousing['Price']


# ## Train Test Split
# 
# Now let's split the data into a training set and a testing set. We will train out model on the training set and then use the test set to evaluate the model.

# In[ ]:


from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split


# In[ ]:


X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.4, random_state=101)


# ## Creating and Training the Model

# In[ ]:


from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression


# In[ ]:


lm = LinearRegression()


# In[ ]:


lm.fit(X_train,y_train)


# ## Model Evaluation
# 
# Let's evaluate the model by checking out it's coefficients and how we can interpret them.

# In[ ]:


print(lm.intercept_)


# In[ ]:


coeff_df = pd.DataFrame(lm.coef_,X.columns,columns=['Coefficient'])
coeff_df


# Interpreting the coefficients:
# 
# - Holding all other features fixed, a 1 unit increase in **Avg. Area Income** is associated with an **increase of \$21.52 **.
# - Holding all other features fixed, a 1 unit increase in **Avg. Area House Age** is associated with an **increase of \$164883.28 **.
# - Holding all other features fixed, a 1 unit increase in **Avg. Area Number of Rooms** is associated with an **increase of \$122368.67 **.
# - Holding all other features fixed, a 1 unit increase in **Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms** is associated with an **increase of \$2233.80 **.
# - Holding all other features fixed, a 1 unit increase in **Area Population** is associated with an **increase of \$15.15 **.
# 
# Does this make sense? Probably not because I made up this data. If you want real data to repeat this sort of analysis, check out the [boston dataset](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_boston.html):
# 
# 

# ## Predictions from our Model
# 
# Let's grab predictions off our test set and see how well it did!

# In[ ]:


predictions = lm.predict(X_test)


# In[ ]:


plt.scatter(y_test,predictions)


# In[ ]:


sns.distplot((y_test-predictions),bins=50);


# In[ ]:


from sklearn import metrics


# In[ ]:


print('MAE:', metrics.mean_absolute_error(y_test, predictions))
print('MSE:', metrics.mean_squared_error(y_test, predictions))
print('RMSE:', np.sqrt(metrics.mean_squared_error(y_test, predictions)))
