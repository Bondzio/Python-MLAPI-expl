# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline
# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory

from subprocess import check_output
print(check_output(["ls", "../input"]).decode("utf8"))

# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.
# Delhi data to accurately predict and forecast the prediction
delhi1 = pd.read_csv("../input/testset.csv")
delhi1.head()
delhi1.describe()
delhi1.isnull().any().any()
delhi1.isnull().sum()
