# This is an implementation of "word vectors" based on Chris Moody's blog post: http://multithreaded.stitchfix.com/blog/2017/10/18/stop-using-word2vec/
# 
# Compared to other popular approaches this is very simple and computational inexpensive but still yields meaningful representations.
# 
# The steps are described very well in Chris' post so I'll go straight to the implementation.

# @driesssens noticed an "Alphabetical bias" in the nearest neighbors and emailed me about it. This means that nearest neighbor words are more likely to start with the same letter compared to a random sample of words. This makes some sense given the propensity for abbreviations and acronyms in tech article titles, but I was surprised how extreme the bias is. The next couple cells measure this by comparing the number of unique first characters in a sample of 10 random words to the number of unique first characters when computing nearest neighbors.
