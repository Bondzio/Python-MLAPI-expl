# # A1: Python Basic Exercises
# The Code Cells below have some Python code with instructions in comments. After each instruction there is an empty Code Cell. Write the Python code necessary to perform the operations. You can check your work at any time by executing the code and reviewing the output.<br><br>When you have finished, submit this homework by sharing your Kaggle notebook. Select the Share icon in the upper right corner of your Kaggle notebook screen. You need to **make your notebook public** by going to Sharing > Privacy and selecting Public. You can then just copy the URL from the browser to submit your notebook on Canvas.

# ### Part 1
# Try out the following exercises to flex your Python printing skills.

# In[ ]:


lst = [10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1] 
otherlst = ['a','b','c','d','e','f','g']
s = "This is a test string for HCDE 530"

#Exercise 1 (working with a list):
#a.	Print the first element of lst (this one has been completed for you)
print(lst[0])
#b.	Print the last element of otherlst

#c.	Print the first five elements of lst

#d.	Print the fifth element of otherlst

#e.	Print the number of items in lst

#Exercise 2 (working with a string):
#a.	Print the first four characters of s

#b.	Using indexing, print the substring "test" from s

#c.	Print the contents of s starting from the 27th character (H)

#d.	Print the last three characters of s

#e.	Print the number of characters in s


# ### Part 2
# In the Code Cell below, write some code to calculate and print 13! (13 factorial)

# In[ ]:





# ### Part 3
# In the Code Cell below, write the code to output "Happy New Year!" using three *different* string variables.

# In[ ]:





# ### Part 4
# In the Code Cell below, write the code to **define** (i.e. create) three functions, in which each function **returns** one string. You should create one function each for the word "Happy", the word "New", and the word "Year!". Execute the three functions and show what they output.

# ### Part 5
# In the Code Cell below, write a new function using the ones you created in the prior problem. Make your new function print "Happy New Year!"

# In[ ]:





# ### Part 6
# In the Code Cell below, write a function that takes two parameters and adds them together. The function should write output that looks like an addition statement. For example, if the function was given the values 3 and 4 the output should be something like: "3 + 4 = 7"
