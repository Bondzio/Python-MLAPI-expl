# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier 
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory

from subprocess import check_output
print(check_output(["ls", "../input"]).decode("utf8"))

# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.

credit_cards= pd.read_csv('../input/creditcard.csv')
columns=credit_cards.columns
credit_cards 

#The labels are in the last column('Class'). Simply remove it to obtain features columns
features_columns=columns.delete(len(columns)-1)
