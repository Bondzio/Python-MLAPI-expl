# In this notebook, I will list some attacks against the current evaluation method.

# ### Suicide Attack
# 
# The game process executes each agent in a new thread, if an agent crashes the game process, the system shows 'ERROR' status for both agents and there is not punishment. Therefore a malicious agent can utilize this loophole to crash before losing the game.
# 
# The code below simulates the game play, in `crash_me` function, the process `p` (the game process) executes a function (an agent) in a thread, we can detect whether a function crashes `p` by checking whether the exit code is not zero.

def execute_in_thread(func):

        t = Thread(target=func)

        t.join()
    except:
        print('exception caught in thread')

def crash_me(func):
    p = Process(target=execute_in_thread, args=(func,))
    p.start()
    p.join()
    if p.exitcode != 0:
        print('process crashed')

    a = [1]
    while True:
        a += a

# commented because it took to long to commit
# crash_me(allocate_lots_of_memory)


# ### Overwrite the Board
# 
# As is pointed out by [Neil Slater](https://www.kaggle.com/slobo777), that player 1 can win by overwriting the board. Combined with suicide attack, we can make an agent that never lose. I added a kill switch to only allow the agent win before a certain date, so that it does not polute the leaderboard too much.
