# 
# In Sub-region analysis with a smaller buffer distance 100 miles and 50 miles from power plant below highlighted plants having Maximum emission factor. 
# While performing analysis in Sub National region with county polygon the maximum emission factor identified in Vieques and Guayanilla. When this analysis reduced to smaller buffer distance from power plant, the maximum emission factor identified in Vieques and Vega Baja counties.
