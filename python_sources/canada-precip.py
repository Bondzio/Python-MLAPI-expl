# Used this idea to create a Dash app that makes a prediction in real-time whether or not there will be precipitation tomorrow for weather stations in Canada. 
# 
# 
# The app is hosted online at https://canada-precip.herokuapp.com/.
# 
# More information and the code/data can be found on [Github](https://github.com/shawndegroot/canada-precip)
