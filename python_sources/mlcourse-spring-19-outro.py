# # mlcourse.ai spring-19 session outro
# 
# It's been the third day since I had nothing to do for mlcourse.ai deadlines. I've been feeling incredibly empty. It's like a great part of your life suddenly disappears and you just don't understand how to act. Trying to fill the emptiness, I've decided to write a short outro about spring-19 mlcourse.ai session. 
# 
# **Not a typical story**
# 
# I suppose, my story is not much typical among the course audience. I'm a simple scientist (not data) specified in analytical chemistry (to be sure, from the title you might think that there's something in common with data analysis, but generally there isn't). It means that I'm not that good at math, don't know much about the IT world and generally I've never really heard about data science and machine learning before October 2018. 
# At that time I found and read an article of one famous Russian data science researcher where he gave some ideas about what is data science and what magic can be performed with such a skill. I was terrified, I honestly couldn't believe that all written there is true. I decided to figure out the truth and went to talk to my friend, who is a developer and, as I'd further found out, had some data science experience. He gave me "Data Science from Scratch" by J. Grus to find the answers. I've read it quickly, the ideas came out somehow clearer than they seemed before. My friend also told me about such a wonderful thing as mlcourse.ai. I'd already missed the current launch at that time, but I felt strongly sure that I must take part in the next session.
# 
# **Journey begins**
# 
# And that's where the journey actually began. I've completed a couple of Python introduction courses just to be able to understand a little part of what's happening. 
# 
# When current session began, I was really terrified. I couldn't understand much of the content and especially what to do with the assignments. Alice was a nightmare, because I've run out of ideas very soon. Then I've somehow dealt to find useful approaches for Medium to beat 2 baselines. Dota 2 competition felt like a great and uncompromising battlefield.
# 
# I've spent so much time on mlcourse.ai lectures, assignments, articles and competitions that suddenly I've started to feel like some of the concepts and ideas finally became familiar! I dealt to write a tutorial on a topic that I truly wanted to cover and it felt great when I first saw it working! 
# And now I really believe that I can, and moreover, should move forward!
# 
# **What makes mlcourse.ai different**
# 
# I'd like to mention a few facts why for me mlcourse.ai outstands many online IT courses, what makes it different and unique:
# 
# - *Absolutely great and easy-to-understand materials;*
# 
# Lectures with theoretical and practical concepts, articles, they all are done with great professionalism so that even people with weak background knowledge (like me) are able to start understanding at least general information.
# 
# - *Great number of materials from different years in open source*
# 
# Demo assignments, different tutorials and kernels from previous years really helped, especially in the beginning of the course.
# 
# - *Organizers*
# 
# Yes, simply. They're true enthusiastic professionals. They help, they share knowledge, they try to understand participants. Incredible!
# 
# - *Nice community*
# 
# As far as I've already found out ML is not only about data and science, but about people, their ideas and interactions. Last competition even gave a chance to work as a team. That's a great thing, isn't?
# 
# **Why should I enter the next session?**
# 
# This section is for those who dismissed current session or those who are in doubt considering whether to start such a journey.
# 
# - *A nice and easy way to gain new skills and techniques.*
# 
# - *A chance to learn much about important concepts in today's IT.*
# 
# - *An ability to boost your career or even to unterstand that you might change it.*
# 
# - *A wonderful chance to have new friends!*
# 
# That's not the full list because each person may have different outcome. But it's still be positive. So, doesn't matter whether you are an analyst, BI, developer or you're even not familiar with IT yet, you definetely should enter and fight!
# 
# **Conclusion**
# 
# In the end I'd like to thank all of the people who were in the organisation group of a current session for such a wonderful experience. Right now I really wish it'd never ended but life had its own rules. 
# 
# I'd like to thank our wonderful community for interesting competitions together, for great discussions in Slack, for outstanding and contradictory ideas shared and discussed in Kaggle Kernels and of course for wonderful and interesting tutorials of the current session. Thank you! Let the data science be with us!
# 
# P. S. Now I'm looking forward to start any good deep learning course and refresh mathematical skills with some great courses. I'd be happy to have a company. 
# And, please, share your ideas on how to move forward? (I hope to get a data scientist or data engineer job someday).
# 
# ***Thanks for your attention. It was a pleasure to be a part of the thing.***
