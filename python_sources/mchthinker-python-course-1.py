# **Part 1:
#     Grammar**

# **variable and constant**
# *    tasks:
# 1. give a variable named 'a' the value 1
# 2. give a variable named 'b' the value "abc"
# 3. give a variable named 'c' the value ["hello", "world"]
# 4. Is a variable changeable?
# 5. Name a constant

# **data types**
# * tasks:
# 1. name a string
# 2. name an integer
# 3. name a list
# 4. name a dictionary
# 5. name a float
# 6. use two ways to represent the word \t I hate you, while \t is the exact value instead of 'tab' sign
# 7. use two ways to interchange x=3 & y='abc', if z=4, use another way to interchange x & z (thx to csd)

# **condition statement**
# * tasks:
# 1. output True if 3 is bigger than 4
# 2. Meanwhile, output 'equal' if 3 is the same as the absolute value of variable x
# 3. Meanwhile, output 'other cases' if neither of the statements are satisfied

# **function(method)**
# * tasks:
# 1. What is the keyword?
# 2. name a function which name is 'func'
# 3. set the parameters 'par1' and 'par2' respectively
# 4. give an initial value to 'par1' which is 33
# 5. make the function return a value which is the sum of par1 and par2, make sure it always works
# 6. use any recursion statement inside function 'func'
# 7. use the lambda expression

# **class**
# * tasks:
# 1. name a class which name is 'animal'
# 2. name two classes which names are 'dog' and 'cat' respectively

# **loop**
# * tasks:
# 1. write a for-loop
# 2. write a while-loop
# 3. use two ways (one type of loop) to traverse the values in [1,2,3,4,5]
# 4. hence, use three ways to output the id of the elements
