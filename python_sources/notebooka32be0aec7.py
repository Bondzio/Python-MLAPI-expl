# # This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# # It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# # For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 
# 
# import numpy as np # linear algebra
# import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)
# 
# # Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.
# # For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory
# 
# from subprocess import check_output
# print(check_output(["ls", "../input"]).decode("utf8"))
# 
# # Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.
