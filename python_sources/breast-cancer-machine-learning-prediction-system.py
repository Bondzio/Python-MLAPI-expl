# We have done a full research analysis report on the Winconsin Breast Cancer Data Set. There is a PDF report on the classification model. 
# 
# You will find all the Jupyter Notebook codes. Lazy to upload here as there are too many files. We have Supervised learning model comparisons on Logistics Regression, KNN Classification, Decision Tree and Neural Networks. We apply Feature Selection to improve the score. 
# 
# For Unsupervised Learning, we apply PCA and we have KMEANS , DBSCAN AND Hierarchial Clustering. 

# Using Python Machine Learning Supervised and Unsupervised Learning Models on Jupyter Notebook
# 
# Report on the various Machine Learning Models on Winconsin Breast Cancer Data Set in the PDF as provided.
# Abstract: In Part A, we will use linear regression. The data has been experimented with 2 types of linear regression model: Multiple Linear Regression and Polynomial Regression.
# 
# In Part B and C, we will use a different dataset which is on Breast Cancer data to apply to supervised and unsupervised machine learning models. Breast cancer is the second highest cause of death from cancer among women, in the case of United States. Breast cancer occurs as a result of tumours in the breast tissue.
# 
# The intention of this study is to design an accurate prediction system through various machine learning models of Python to predict whether a tumour is malignant or benign.
# 
# The usage of machine learning and deep learning techniques in healthcare analysis and diagnostics is growing rapidly. Most of the possible medical flaws can be minimized by using classification models that also allow the data to be analysed faster, more accurately and more comprehensively (Kumari and Singh,2018).
