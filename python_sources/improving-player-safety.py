###How to improve on player safety while increasing ratings in the NFL. My proposals are the ones listed 1. and 2. The rest of the text is notes on each play with injury###

1.	Gamekey# 54, Play ID# 1045. *Clip can be used as an example to players. The injury looks to be between player #41 of Pittsburgh who is on the receiving end of a helmet to helmet block by #50 of Carolina. The thing is this is exactly what they should be trying to avoid. This is #50 agenda all along. The ball is supposed to be ran to the right by design and these players are supposed to be making blocks that have been set up for them by design of the play. If they can design this play to happen like so, they can tell the players making the blocks to not leap for the head. A lot of good that may do however, because this has been tried and failed continuously in the past. So, to avoid these kind of things we shall together develop a simulation program that trains the eye of the player to avoid helmet to helmet contact through virtual reality/simulations. If this simulation ends up turning into something that tracks points for doing well or poorly, then a test can be required before the season starts requiring a player to score __ many points in order to be deemed "trained to go (ttg)" aka has taken THIS YEAR'S (means we're doing this annually, the test will be updated annually as well to compensate for anything necessary) offseason helmet to helmet training and successfully passed the test of the eye and mind before the season starts. Perhaps virtual reality goggles can help make this possible, or a simulation room designed specifically for this in every NFL facility.  NASA – RAIF program should be something the NFL begins to investigate. Microsoft’s Halo lens is another potential design the NFL could use for the “VR/Halo training”. Sure it will cost money, but the NFL is investing in a long term solution. The NFL can afford to aid the players and their safety. If Bruce Arians and Carson Palmer used VR goggles to read defenses, and Halo lens football animations are possible to create then you must be able to teach these players how to avoid helmet collisions through a game designed in that fashion. Such as hitting the hologram of the opponent in the head results in a -1 point while avoided the helmet and maintaining form results in a +1. This game is going to become popular among programs throughout the NFL and college level if done right. VR testing can allow players to miss helmets just by moving their head a little in testing. This will do a lot in terms of avoidance in live scenarios.

2.	5-ON-5 rule. More detail on this will be further provided upon request. 5 on 5 rule could prevent unknown blocks from occurring. Where unknown blocks = blind side blocks, crack back blocks, double wedge blocks, ect. Dave Toub would be a great person to get a second opinion on this idea ul whether or not it is feasible to experiment with in the NFL. Next pre season we could experiment with it.

Below are my notes of each of the 37 plays which resulted in injury and I ask you to please read: (Eric Reid’s $20,000 fine gets justified in the notes)

1.	Form tackling. In fact, tackling like that COULD be considered a penalty because taking players legs out like that is a cop out for tackling with form. It seems kind of lazy in some cases. Players who take out the legs on a consistent basis need to be called out, but everyone does it every now and again it seems so how do we get the repeat offenders to stop and the unusual suspects to completely avoid it?? Possibly? On punts the issue is a little different because of the situation such as how fast people are going and how long they've sustained such a speed. Players colliding at high speeds from on punt is like a CB hitting a WR that is running full speed and catching the ball without looking at the defender that is about to make a huge hit. (In this case the WR is the punt returner and the CB is the tackling player on punt team, but the case is still the same. The only difference is this time the player with the ball is looking AT you (PR) knowing the hit is coming and still he's continuing to run full speed while the defender is also running full speed trying to make the hit still.)  Hopefully that explanation can give perspective as to how big of an impact there can be when tackling on a punt due to the velocity at the point of collision thus making this a very important issue to solve. Players on special teams are less experienced (typically not starters, so they get the less experienced title) which can potentiate the odds of an injury to occur. Perhaps special teams needs to have mandatory tackling drills or something just due to the sheer velocity that comes with special teams plays and the probable lack of experience (compared to starters) when it comes to form tackling. Serious though...do players on special teams even think about form tackling or is their assignment to get the returner on the ground by any means necessary?   If I was coaching it'd probably be the latter however it could lead to injuries that are bad not only for the player and his team, but also it is very bad look on the NFL  and will continue to look worse every time this kind of injury occurs. This player self-inflicts his concussion because he is not form tackling. However this tackle is a legal tackle (if this continues it is going to make people question the credibility of coaches and owners that say we are always working on tackling or whatever). This being a legal tackle while the NFL is "trying their hardest" (no hate here just identifying what most fans thought processes are right now when it comes to player safety in the NFL) to eliminate anything that can cause injury is bullshit. Again just being honest as I am trying to relay to owners how the fans are currently thinking about these things. The reason it is BS is because it is a tackle that is obviously unsafe for both players. Surprisingly it was the tackler who got hurt diving for the legs and not the guy who could have had his leg broken if the angle is wrong. So we have a tackle that has great potential to harm either player involved, yet it is still legal. No person carrying the ball wants their legs cut out from under them and they speak up about it too, but they get ignored. Maybe it's time we finally eliminate diving for the knees or below on punt (would probably have to do this for everything else too, but perhaps its time). There will be defenders very upset if you do this however. Even Eric Berry will have tackles that he dives for the legs and this guy is a great form tackler, so how do we get everyone on the same page without having to make a judgement penalty call every time this occurs? Perhaps a hefty fine for any player diving for the legs (below the knees). God gave us thighs and shins. Thighs have a bit of cushion while shins are rock solid. It's clear one of his reasonings for this was so that players don't cut out other players legs below the knees. Keep it above the knees and the impact is not nearly as injury prone. If below the knees tackling occurs and a fine does get implemented I would like to be in charge of said fine. I believe I am qualified and capable enough to make the judgement on whether the hit is worthy of a fine and how much. How much the fine will cost will depend on the play of course and what all could have been prevented or done differently (did the guy even try to keep it above the knees type of thing, how fast was he going, was he right in front of the ball carrier or was it some kind of play that called for the tackler to stretch himself thus leading to a below the knee tackle on accident). More suggestions on how to prevent this specific play coming

2.	If a player on team A is engaged/blocking or making an attempt to engage/block a player on team B then any other player on team A can not attempt to block that same player on team B while he is already engaged. See chop block and apply similar concepts. NFL players are smart but it seems like it'll still be hard to just say, hey we can't do these kind of things and we should consider it something sort of a like a chop block or two man wedge, but still second nature may lurk. That's why if we plan to use this strategy of just saying this isn’t allowed or else it could result in penalty or fine, we must let this rule develop into its own. We must let the refined punt develop itself. This isn't going to be like kickoff where we eliminate almost all injuries by moving the ball up five yards and rely on touchbacks. This will be tougher to implement so we need to understand that from the start. However the great thing about the players is that they are coachable. Also, most special teams players can't afford too many fines. Eventually players will force themselves to not do some of these things that are being eliminated. As of now nothing major has been (potentially) removed so I think we are 2 for 2 IF the idea of penalties and fines is deemed worthy enough as a way to reduce the risk of injuries. Theory of eliminating the punt altogether (almost) coming later. Several ideas > one idea don’t hesitate to keep going ....Let's discuss the referees next. We have three refs on the goal line and none of them are looking at the block. Actually they are all looking at the ball, why? Referees need to have assignments on punt, and MUST stick to their assignments so we can catch these things mid game instead of next day. Consistency is key with the refs and it upsets players and fans alike when the refs aren't calling the game properly or are making poor choices such as three refs watching the same thing. We see this far too often, although I have no idea how three refs got on the goal line here...these kind of miscues end up being very costly to the game overall. Also, a lot of these changes could be discussed amongst the NFLPA as well and I would love to hear what they think of some of these things. Clearly those kind of tackles like the one above this play happen all the time, but it seems to be the same players doing it. If new rules are made natural selection will take place amongst players in the NFL with the defenders who do form tackle being a the top of this "species". Players who don't want to stop tackling head first into a pair of ankles will have to change or else they won't be able to keep up. Special teams players are even more prone to change due to lack of funds if fined and are still trying to work their way up the ladder so have incentive to be as coachable as possible. The last couple sentences may seem kind of messed up if you're looking from the players perspective, but you know what the NFL just settled a HUGE case. They do not want to do that again so it should be on the players to get right as well because the NFL isn't going to continue to settle lawsuits they will say these are our changes and you as a player need to make these changes because TOGETHER we can prevent head injuries. If we are to run this thing like so I will need to come up with as many clips as possible of things you can and cant do. Maybe four people playing (three in linebacker position and one in front of returner) shouldn't be allowed? Don't really agree with that necessary but what I do agree with is that PUNT RETURN is much more favorable in terms of making a big play simply because they can have all these guys already waiting for the punt team and blocks are being set up similar to those on kick return.

3.	This is similar to 3129 in terms of how the injury occurs. Looks like they're going for punt block. Gunners are one on one. Here we quickly can see that "punt block" is actually punt block/crack back line. They are clearly putting themselves in position to form the line and make blind side blocks. Will follow up plenty on this. They don't even go for the block. They're only lining up for the block because they want to set up the punt return. Nobody even jumps or makes a move inward to make the block. If this punt return played out like Washington had planned, are there several crack back blocks? If so this should not be legal...unless the players can make the pick block or something other than rocking the guy who isn’t looking at him. Must stay away from the head. If you do have a legal block that DE-cleats the player and contact is made to the head it must be an instant fine. I don't know how other people feel about lining up the crack backs and am very interested in knowing how players feel about these blocks and this type of punt return scheme. Crack backs on punts = injury by velocity and force. Player is typically is trying to make that big hit, and the fans like those big hits as long as there isn't an injury. Can't have your cake and eat it too. That's what makes this so important is that player safety and ratings are both at stake, but we don't want to do TOO MUCH to take away from ratings. The goal is to eliminate all injuries on punt while increasing NFL ratings. Perhaps some big hits should stay but their must be provisions. 

4.	While it does look like 93's initial hit is the one to cause the concussion I don’t think we should rule out the possibility of it the concussion occurring due to the back to back head hits he takes instead of just the first one. Sort of like an aftershock to an earth quake, but it's hard to say that with any real confidence.

5.	*Video could be shown as an example for future. This injury looks like it comes from players 33 and 36 of Buffalo colliding with one another helmet to helmet with 33 taking most of the impact. If I'm understanding the data correctly, the player punt data csv says that number 39 of the defense (which in this case is actually controversial to who is on defense because some would say punt coverage is offense the whole time and others would say it switches when the ball is caught and advanced forward by the return team). The other player involved is #41 and I don't see number 41 of Detroit with any blows to the head. I don't see a #41 for Buffalo on special team so perhaps I’m misreading the data here, but from what I can tell #33 and #36 of Buffalo are the two players we should be looking at here. If you look (and this is a reason why the Eric Reid fine against the Saints this year was perfectly fine with me) both players attempt to assist in this tackle as the player is already being tackled. Now while they practice gang tackling and flying to the football, we have to be smart here. Both players begin the "break down" process of their tackle as the player begins to become fully wrapped up by #91. As they are breaking down they recognize the player is going down or else their motion towards the tackle would not have been at the angle it is at. With that said, this play in real time is evidence of how hard it will be to prevent these kinds of things. That's why this clip should be used in the lockers rooms during the offseason when ppl have time to think about and prepare for these kinds of changes. But neither player NEEDS to extend/throw themselves at the tackle however they are taught to finish till the whistle and have been taught so since 2nd grade. Again this is why we have to show this thing to players. They must be careful and try and maintain some understanding of when a player is actually going to the ground. In real time this clip shows that it's hard to prevent, but if we try and give the players some examples of what could happen when you try and tackle a player already headed to the ground ON PUNT COVERAGE. Since it is punt coverage the odds of another player or two being within your vicinity and wanting to make the tackle are fairly good, and that is something players on special teams MUST be aware of. Eric Berry knows his surrounding at all times. He has trained himself to become this way and I believe other players including those on special teams can increase there sort of feel for their surroundings. Other than that these plays are hard to avoid and the impact is not as great as other plays however a concussion still occurs. These kinds of concussions I believe will be eliminated once a new type of helmet hits the market do to the low velocity of this specific impact/blow to the head.

6.	 *Clip can be used as an example to players. The injury looks to be between player #41 of Pittsburgh who is on the receiving end of a helmet to helmet block by #50 of Carolina. The thing is this is exactly what they should be trying to avoid. This is #50 agenda all along. The ball is supposed to be ran to the right by design and these players are supposed to be making blocks that have been set up for them by design of the play. If they can design this play to happen like so, they can tell the players making the blocks to not leap for the head. A lot of good that may do however, because this has been tried and failed continuously in the past. So, to avoid these kind of things we shall together develop a simulation program that trains the eye of the player to avoid helmet to helmet contact through virtual reality/simulations.

Perhaps virtual reality goggles can help make this possible, or a simulation room designed specifically for this in every NFL facility.  NASA – RAIF program should be something the NFL begins to look into.

7.	Alexander, possibly twice?

8.	This is almost friendly fire IMO. Awareness and recognition of surroundings are important here. We'll see if these kind of injuries continue.

9.	DJ Alexander? This is another examle/reasoning for why eric reid got fined. His hit clearly could have put MT13 out for the next couple weeks. Plus injuries to the head pile on. So if thomas had already suffered a couple concussions (no clue) in his career and somehow suffered another on the Eric reid hit then that could have put him out for several games due to the fact that concussions pile on top of each other and if this is a third one then somebdy must take notice to how his head is going to be long term. I don't know enough about the amount of concussions caused before something srsly life threatening transpires, but it[piling on] does happen. So we HAVE to be careful when it comes to these hits. And it HAS to be used as a learning technique for the future of the player because the future of his employer, the NFL, is at stake here. These types of hits that result in a players neck almost snapping in one direction can result in a very srs injury. However, why didn't anyone show this stuff to Eric Reid? He made a deal about getting fined on twitter. Why not just show these guys the damn videos of their own mistakes and let the compare those videos to videos with similar hits that reulted in injury. Maybe then they will be more hesistant to dispute the fine instead of accept that maybe a hit like that shouldn't be allowed. The perks of being a well paid football player is that you cn afford to pay for mistakes. It's just part of it. That's one way to really get players to pay attention and if you choose to pay them more money for the sole purpose of being able to afford a mistake once in awhile then the payers should be a little more accepting when plays like this occur. Will start a list of each player on here eventually. If player is involved in an injury more than once than perhaps some extra training be awarded? Logically speaking it makes sense that a couple of players are to be more at fault than a majority of players. Although I have no basis to make that assumption just yet it may surface soon. More to come. Take advatage of the degrees/angle on this play (listed in other excel SS). Soon we will be able to tell with some confidence what degrees/angles are resulting in the most injuries and we shall see if that data can spark any new thoughts such as eliminating certain "actions/tackles/ways to tackle based strictly on the dreegs/angle that tackle represented in the past knwing now that it is more likely to lead to injuries we could possibly prevent those by avoidance of the action. More to come these are just noteworthy thoughts.


10.	Did not note anything here.

11.	Player leaves his feet. Dives helmet first into the returner's body. Simulation room/VR will teach #81 to take another approach on this tackle.

12.	Looks like 42 gets blocked into 81. Hard to believe it's 81 who ends up with the concussion here but perhaps it is due to his speed being slower than the speed of the action that caused the impact. Another peel back/crack back/blindside block howver the hit was very effective when it comes to preventing the opponents from tackling your ball carrier. Other thoughts.. Eliminating the blind side hit altogether, create a helmet that can take this kind of impact, or begin training your mind and eyes in the simulation room and with VR to avoid making helmet to helmet contact. A combination of the two latter would be a great benefit to the process of eliminating injuries plus it allows us to perhaps even keep these kind of big hits in the long run so long players can learn to avoid the helmet as well as wear a safer helmet themselves. If a player has an 80-90 degree angle on an opponent that is running after the ball carrier and not looking at the player who is about to hit him then the player making the hit must be fined if making helmet to helmet contact at this angle no matter whos at fult because if he is no longer allowed to position himself at the said angle unless he throws a block that is correct. That whole sentence is hard to type. Putting self in both shoes now so next i'd say...And it shouldn't just be that simple to say the angle of the block isn't legal because now the blockers are at a disadvantage however the punt team has always been at a disavantage because these kind of blocks get set up by design and it's almost like russian roulette as to who is going to be on the receiving end of the hit. Knowing that these hits are designed to be big time blocks makes it hard to just say it's ok though. Fans love these kind of big blocks though. It can be good for ratings if done right, but it seems more detrimental to the NFL if these injuries continue due to blind side blocks as opposed to doing something about it even if it's very minor. If the NFL were to say blind side blocks on punts are fine for the next 10 years and then we come to find out that it was blind side blocks that caused 10% of all concussions on punt then it would make the NFL look really bad. Got to continue to think long term. Further than 10 years out. This plays concussion isn't directly resulting from the blind side hit but the fact that both players were unaware that they were about to take a hit and can not brace for impact at that point then does it really matter if it is directly from the hit or not? Those five extra yards are not > or equal to a concussion. In fact they are < by a great amount as important as that player's mental stability. NFL might not like the fact that I would take out such a "football type" of hit. Not saying it needs to be removed just yet............BUT lets say now that 35% of concussions on punts were directly or indirectly results from a blind side hit. That is 7 out of every 20 concussions on punt. Not very many by any means AKA this is the more realistic % to associate with punt. CHECK ON THIS! Have several prediction opportunities in this project as well so take advatage with these types of numbers too.. so audience can perceive in their own way all while the numbers should speak for themselves. If an idea comes up and need some evidence as to why it should be supported please refer to some numbers and give some predictions that are legitamate and eye-opening.

13.	If this is timed correctly the concussion is forgoten and #22 is looked at as making a big time play in the 4th. Sentence should speak vloumes because it's true. The concussion isn't actually forgoten but sproles injury isn't going to be remembered by fans as much as the play that came from it (if Washington were to have recovered of course). Other thoughts.. look at the Eagles as they are letting the punt team go ahead in front of them. Perhaps it should be reuqired that all players stick to a man on punt??? Similar to how DBs stick to gunners on punt. This would make for some good matchups and can even make special teams a more "prove it or lose it" type of thing both for the players on the brink of breaking out or a player that is in his last game unless he can BEAT THE MAN ACROSS FROM HIM. If we were to roll with this thought then maybe if a guy chooses to hang back a little bit instead of trying to stay on the block in front of him than he shall be penalized? Or warned post game that could lead to fine if done too often? Feel like this would give special teams players an even greater chance to prove themselves to coaches. This is not a good idea.
14.	Injury here is from the guy cutting on the far right of the punt team (not gunner). Player cuts opponent going for punt block and injures himself in the process?? Wonder how often concussions occur on cut blocks. If 12% of kickoffs result in concussions then 12% should be our mark for when something should be done? For example if cut blocks lead to a concussion 15% of the time no matter if it's offense, defense, or special teams...should that be enough to rid the cut block?
15.	Player tackles ball carrier from the side and makes helmet to helmet contact. Looks to be leading with his helmet.
16.	52 looks like he rubs across the front of 47d and injures him in the process. Worse than it looks.
17.	32 hits the punter in the head as they are both going to the ground. Very hard to avoid something like this as they are both in the process of changing direction somewhat. Simulation room/VR can teach 32 to instinctively put his shoulder into the guy first instead of his helmet. The goal is to make it second nature to these guys to avoid the helmet and avoid leading with your own helmet. Use Carson Palmer/Bruce Arians story. (This was about Carson Palmer using VR goggles to read defenses and if that is possible, and Halo lens football animations are possible to create then you must be able to teach these players how to avoid helmet collisions through a game designed in that fashion. Such as hitting the halograph of the opponent in the head results in a -1 point while avoided the helmet and maintaining form results in a +1. This game is going to become popular among programs throughout the NFL and college level if done right.)
18.	The stick that designates the first down yard mark needs to have a camera in it so reviews on the spot of the football have a angle right down the line in college and NFL.
19.	#36 gets injured during the tackle. Hard to tell that it is his head taking the majority of the impact however if this is the case then VR goggles will train his eye well enough to lean a little more to the left when making his tackle. <- that is if the injury came from the initial tackle, but it actually comes from friednly fire after #36 makes the tackle. This is just dumb and im sure #37 felt awful after this. But that is what special teams players MUST pay attention to.  BECAUSE SPECIAL TEAM GUYS ARE ALWAYS TRYING TO PROVE THEMSELVES THEY WILL TEND TO JUMP IN ON THESE KINDS OF THINGS. THEY WANT TO DO ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO START ON SUNDAYS INCLUDING GETTING AN ASSIST ON A TACKLE, BUT THIS ISNT AN ASSIST BECAUSE THE PLAYER IS ALREADY DOWN AND THIS IS SOMETHING SPECIAL TEAMS PLAYERS MUST BE AWARE OF IN THE FUTURE. I WILL HAVE A COUNT OF HOW MANY TIMES A TEAMMATE ASSISTING IN A TACKLE HAS CAUSED AN INJURY. ONCE AGAIN SPECIAL TEAMS PLAYERS MUST PUT IT ON THEMSELVES TO BE AWARE OF THESE THINGS. Fines could be an answer for this in the future if we see this kind of thing continue several times in a year.  This kind of thing could have happened on offense or defense as well.
20.	#86 makes the tackle and loses his helmet in the process. He leaps and leads the tackle with his helmet.
21.	#85 gets blocked by #45 and then goes to assist in the tackle.
22.	Looks like #39 gets blocked into someone else on the play
23.	#35 goes in for the tackle and as its slipping through his arms #53 comes in and makes the tackle. The tackle then falls back toward #35. He either gets hit in the head by body part or foot/shoe.
24.	If a player is coming in hot like that and KNOWS, because YOU DO KNOW WHEN YOURE ABOUT TO THROW A BIG ASS BLOCK. IVE PLAYED THE GAME FOR LONG ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT YOU CAN SEE AND COMPREHEND THE BLOCK THAT IS ABOUT TO TAKE PLACE BEFORE IT TAKES PLACE. It is the most effective way to throw a block though, and these guys NEED to prove themselves in the preseason more than ever. So the equalizer that I continue to go back to is simulation room/VR testing.
25.	Some of these becoming harder to tell. Looks like #53 goes into the tackle making contact with his helmet right away? VR testing can allow players to miss helmets just by moving their head a little in testing. This will do a lot in terms of avoidance in live scenarios.
26.	The running into the kicker almost looks intentional. Bolden looks like he jumps into Colquitt. This is helmet to body impact during the tackle. Very unfortunate.
27.	This shows as helmet to ground. Only one player could have done that here but the numbers don't seem to match again. Player needs to be careful. This video can be shown as an example to all just how much the ground can impact you if you slam your head onto it and if you can take precautions during your fall, do so. Hopefull the training during VR testing will keep players from bouncing their head of the ground face first. Also, #31 (I think) takes on a block in this clip. He could have easily gotten injured since he went into the block with his helmet. The guy throwing the block lead with his shoulder but the guy on the other end doesnt and that kind of thing can cause a head injury as well.
28.	YOU CAN'T MAKE THOSE KIND OF BLOCKS STANDING STRAIGHT UP. YOURE JUST ASKING FOR INJURY. LEAD WITH YOUR SHOULDER
29.	#49's helmet goes into the knee of #50 of Oakland. Looks like this would have been hard to avoid unless helmets that could take this kind of impact were worn. Perhaps all special teams players should where shin guards? Leaves a little cushion to brace for impact however this was his knee, not his shin, so a shin guard wouldn't have helped here, but other times perhaps. Not a good idea in the grand scheme of things though.
30.	#34 leads with helmet here and it ends up injuring the returner. Stands over him afterwards which should be considered taunting in my opinion. We need to stop looking at concussions like they are a successful outcome after a big hit. Players included. As a player, you're not hard by hitting this guy at an angle that prevents him from getting up afterwards. He's injured and thats why he is still lying there, you didnt knock the wind out of him due to your pure strength and form tackling.
31.	#51 is on the receiving end of a very poor block. Looks like both players are injured here. People need to be aware of how they are blocking and what poor blocking can lead to. A seminar for all special teams players must be held or something so all these videos can be reviewed. Too many things here that would be worth the time for the players to sit down and watch.
32.	Pretty sure this is #26 and #32 not #38 and #32. #32 must pay attention to how he is blocking. VR training.
33.	This play's injury happens when #44 getting blocked by #55 helmet to helmet. Again #55 needs to be aware of how he is blocking.
34.	I think the returner is the injured one on this play. #14 looks like he makes helmet to helmet contact as he tackles the player. Form tackling is a must here.
35.	#42 is on the receving end of a blow to the head here. As he goes to assist in taking the player down, the player is already leaing head forward and it is just bad timing when he goes to assist in the tackle. I believe #87 would have gone down without #42.
36.	It looks like #85 on the punt team and #53 on the return team make helmet to helmet contact at the beginning of the play. #85 looks to be on the receiving end of the injury.
37.	Hard to tell where the injury occurs here exactly. Players must acknowledge how they are blocking others. If we can get players to recognize where/how/why the majority of these concussions are happening as well as get them to watch these clips. I truly believe that it will go a long way with these players.
