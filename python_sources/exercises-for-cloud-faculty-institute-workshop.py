# 
# * Kaggle InClass Competitions and Kaggle Kernels

# The goal of this exercise is to familiarize you with: (1) Kaggle; (2) Kaggle Kernels; and (3) Kaggle InClass Competitions.
# * [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) is a place to share data science [projects](https://www.kaggle.com/explore-projects).
# * [Kernels](https://www.kaggle.com/new-project) is a platform for hosting [reproducible data projects](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=B1eYYK5QgX).
# * [InClass Competitions](https://www.kaggle.com/inclass) are self-service data science [competitions](https://www.kaggle.com/challenge-yourself).

# **Assignment #1:
# **
# 
# 1. Signup for an account on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).
# 1. Navigate to the [Cloud Faculty Institute Workshop InClass Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/cloud-faculty-institute-workshop).
# 1. Briefly review the [starter kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/how-to-participate-in-inclass-competitions). ([Python](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/predict-diabetes-with-python-starter-kernel)/[R](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/predict-diabetes-with-r-starter-kernel))

# **Assignment #2:
# **
# 
# 1. Click on the "Fork Notebook" button in the top right corner of the [starter kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/how-to-participate-in-inclass-competitions). ([Python](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/predict-diabetes-with-python-starter-kernel)/[R](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/predict-diabetes-with-r-starter-kernel))
# 1. Run your new fork by pressing the "Fast Forward" button in the bottom left corner of the kernel editor.
# 1. Commit your kernel by pressing the "Commit & Run" button in the top right corner of the kernel editor.
# 1. Click on the "View Snapshot" button after waiting for the kernel to finish running.
# 1. Click on the "Output" tab then find your submission file and click "Submit to Competition".
# 

# **Extra Credit #1:
# **
# 
# 1. Click on the "Fork Notebook" button in the top right corner of the [starter kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/how-to-participate-in-inclass-competitions). ([Python](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/predict-diabetes-with-python-starter-kernel)/[R](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/predict-diabetes-with-r-starter-kernel))
# 1. Modify the code to make improvements to the benchmark model. 
# 1. Submit your results to the InClass competition.  Were you able to improve the model?
# 
# Hint: 
# The easiest change to make would be to drop fewer features.  Another easy improvement would be to use a more sophisticated model such as [RandomForest](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html) or [XGBoost](http://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/get_started/).
# 

# **Extra Credit #2:
# **
# 
# 1. Navigate to the [Cloud Faculty Institute Workshop InClass Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/cloud-faculty-institute-workshop).
# 1. Click on the "Kernels" tab and then click on the "New Kernel" button in the top right corner.
# 1. Select that you want to create a new notebook then wait for the kernel editor to load.
# 1. Use the dropdown menu to switch between Python and R according to your preference.
# 1. Build an original machine learning model.  Try to predict diabetes from medical records.
# 1. Submit your results to the InClass competition.  Try to get a higher score than your neighbor!
# 
# Hint: Find inspiration from the [work of others](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database/kernels).

# **Extra Credit #3:
# **
# 
# 1. Identify an ML-friendly [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
# 1. Split the dataset into training and testing subsets.
# 1. Create an answer key and a sample submission file.
# 1. Set up your own [InClass competition](https://www.kaggle.com/inclass) on Kaggle.
# 
# Hint: See the [How to prepare data for InClass competitions](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/how-to-setup-an-inclass-competition) kernel.
