# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error # metrics

# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory

import os
print(os.listdir("../input"))

# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.

train = pd.read_csv('../input/train.csv')
test = pd.read_csv('../input/test.csv')


# In[4]:


pred = np.array([train['target'].mean() for i in range(test.shape[0])])


# In[6]:


np.save('prediction.npy',pred)
