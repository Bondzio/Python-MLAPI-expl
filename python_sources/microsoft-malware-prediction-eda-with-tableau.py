# ## **Microsoft Malware Prediction - EDA with Tableau**
# 
# 
# This exploratory data analysis aim to help other Kaggle users that want to be part of the Microsoft Malware Prediction competition. 
# 
# Charts/Sheets are organized according to their value for a future machine learning model. Value refers to the feature distribution and how significant is the difference between the detection or not of a malware (HasDetection feature). Charts with (r) or (n) mean that, in my opinion, that feature should be removed , (i)  is for features that can be interest for the model. Meaning that charts with (r) have a very similar distribution when comparing to malwared detection. (n) for the variables with 50% or more missing values.
# 
# **Number of features:** 83
# 
# **Label:** HasDetections
# 
# **(i)  - Total of 31 features: ** AppVersion, AVProductsEnabled, AVProductsInstalled, AVProductStatesIdentifier, AvSigVersion, Census_FirmwareVersionIdentifier, Census_IsAlwaysOnAlwaysConnectedCapable, Census_IsTouchEnabled, Census_IsVirtualDevice, Census_OEMModelIdentifier, Census_OEMNameIdentifier, Census_OSArchitecture, Census_OSBranch, Census_OSBuildRevision, Census_OSSkuName, Census_OSUILocaleIdentifier, Census_PrimaryDiskTotalCapacity, Census_ProcessorModelIdentifier, Census_SystemVolumeTotalCapacity, CityIdentifier, CountryIdentifier, EngineVersion, GeoNameIdentifier, IsSxsPassiveMode, LocaleEnglishNameIdentifier, OsBuildLab, OsPlatformSubRelease, Processor, ProductName, Wdft_IsGamer, Wdft_RegionIdentifier
# 
# **(n) - 2:** Census_InternalBatteryType, Census_ProcessorClass
# 
# The rest is (r).
# 
# * Please use the charts below to take your own conclusions and remember that this is an initial exploration.
