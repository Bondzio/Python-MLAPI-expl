# dysfunction including acute respiratory distress syndrome  ards   shock  acute cardiac injury  and acute renal injury

# 15. prevalence of malignancy was higher in males, it was found that in severe covid 19 patients  those with cancer had 
# poorer outcomes from covid 19 in addition  more men in our study were co infected with bacteria or   influenza virus  
# which may somewhat result in high risk...it will be clinically meaningful to further investigate why and which type of 
# influenza virus or   bacteria are more likely to co infect with sars cov 2 in men another  we observed that ntprobnp but 
# not ctni was higher in men  suggesting more damage in heart function might exist in men after sars cov 2 infection  it 
# was reported that women were associated with less remodeling after cardiac injury  due to the  protection of estrogens  
# our findings imply that physicians should pay more attention to cardiac function in men with severe covid 19

# 18. microbiota are altered by immune depletion associated with novel coronavirus infection can help us have a better 
# understanding of the  characteristics of covid 2019 based on our findings  we suggested that the  early interventions of host immune system and gut microbiota are necessary for covid 2019 patients with refractory hypoxia  for these critical patients  extracorporeal membrane oxygenation  ecmo  therapy also should be supported early to ameliorate the  symptom of refractory hypoxia in conclusion  we discussed the  dynamic characteristics of host immune system

# 19. covid 19 patients had decreased serum calcium levels  calcium influx regulates both clathrin mediated and clathrin 
# independent endocytosis during viral infection  thus constituting a key mechanism for regulation of influenza a virus 
# internalization and infection 16   based on this theory  calcium channel blockers  including amlodipine  verapamil  and 
# diltiazem  as well as bapta am  have been proven effective in inhibiting iav replication in a dose dependent manner in a 
# canine kidney cell model 17   moreover  diltiazem may have both prophylactic and therapeutic effects in iav treatment 
# according to both ex vivo and in vivo testing 17   we therefore propose the  hypothesis that ca 2  levels and or   ca 2  
# channels may play a role in endocytosis and infection of sars cov 2  further studies are needed
